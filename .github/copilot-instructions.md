# Luxury Perfume Brand Website - Copilot Instructions

This is a luxury perfume brand website built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

## Design Guidelines
- **Color Palette**: Use luxury color scheme (black #1a1a1a, off-white #fafafa, beige #f5f2ed, gold #d4af37)
- **Typography**: Serif fonts (Playfair Display) for headings, clean sans-serif (Inter) for body text
- **Style**: Modern French boutique meets exclusive artisan - minimal, chic, and high-end
- **Animations**: Subtle fade, slide-in, or scroll-triggered animations with Framer Motion

## Component Structure
- Keep components small and focused
- Use custom luxury color classes from tailwind.config.js
- Implement smooth transitions and hover effects
- Ensure responsive design (mobile-first approach)

## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices with functional components and hooks
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Implement proper SEO meta tags
- Keep animations subtle and purposeful - this is luxury, not flashy

## Key Features
- Sticky navbar with semi-transparent blur
- Full-screen hero with parallax background
- Interactive product grid with hover zoom
- Clean contact form with validation
- Smooth page transitions
- FAQ accordion (optional)

Remember: This is artisan luxury, not fast fashion. Everything should feel calm, luxurious, and intentional.
